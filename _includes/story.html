        Jos and Hannah met on January 4th, 2024, after messaging on Bumble for
        approximately a month, and rescheduled a date because Hannah forgot what
        days they’d be out of town for the Holidays (Classic Hannah). They had
        their first date on a cold January evening at Bar Ona. Hannah bought the
        first round, which was really endearing to Jos (Jos later learned Hannah
        had to borrow money from their best friend, Jeremy, for the date). Of
        course, Jos had to introduce Hannah to Malort, and somehow Hannah stuck
        around. After drinks, despite Hannah’s hesitancy to move to a secondary
        location, they walked to the 21c and admired the art before saying good
        night.<br />
        <br />Several dates followed, including a brunch date where they shared
        their first kiss, and a dinner date where they cooked dinner together
        while drinking the first bottle of wine they ever shared and listening
        to vinyl. After dinner, Jos figured out why people always fall for
        musicians as Hannah played guitar and sang for them. After that evening,
        Hannah and Jos were pretty inseparable. While they both knew they were
        pretty smitten with each other, around a month in, Hannah announced,
        “I’m not saying it cause that would be crazy, but I really want to say I
        love you.” (Hannah claims this is not saying it first). After some back
        and forth, Jos went ahead and said, “I love you.”<br /><br />
        After several months of spending most evenings together, the topic of
        moving in came up, and 6 months in, Hannah moved in with Jos at their
        home on Wilgus. The rest of that year was a bit of a wash, though. Jos
        lost their job, and Hannah’s car broke down. They severely sprained
        their ankle and lost their PhD advisor. The political landscape changed
        entirely for the worse. Hannah and Jos were always there for each other
        with kindness, care, and compassion, even when things really sucked.<br /><br />
        Together, Hannah and Jos have built a beautiful life full of friendship,
        joy, bike rides, wine tastings, crafts, movie nights, cute cats, cool
        art, good music, deep support for each other, and enough intellectual
        debate to keep them both on their toes. Just like everything else in
        their relationship, they decided to get engaged cooperatively. Over a
        period of three months, they had a series of lengthy discussions on
        whether, how, and when to get engaged. They decided they would announce
        the engagement with photos taken (and seen here!) by their friend and
        neighbor Jessi at Bar Ona where they had their first couple of dates.<br /><br />
        We look forward to sharing this special day with you and including you
        all in the next step of our story!
